This news website uses APIs to collect and display data on a variety of categories, such as politics, sports, entertainment, and technology. It offers up-to-date and comprehensive coverage on each topic, with articles and multimedia content that are easy to access and navigate. Users can quickly find the information they need on the website, making it a go-to source for news and current events.  
This is my first responsive React website built using Material UI.
